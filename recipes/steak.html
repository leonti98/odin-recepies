    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This steak marinade is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time, it's made me famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist.</li>
        <li>Sauces: You'll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it's a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat.</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic. </li>
    </ul>
